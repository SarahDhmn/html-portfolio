<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everyone, I'm Sarah and I love coding. I'm slowly learning how to code so please bear with me and my website look, it's a work in progress.</p>

<p>I was a French teacher but decided to change my career, I'm very happy with this change and I'm excited to learn more.</p>

<p>I love the frontend part of coding, I'm hoping to make it my new career.</p>
